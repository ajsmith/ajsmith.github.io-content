Well it looks like I'm starting a new blog, and I'd like to start off with a
few words about my mission and what I aim to cover here.

This is a blog about my personal adventures in software engineering. It will
likely include opinions on various technology topics, lessons learned from the
things I work on, announcements related to public projects I'm part of, and
perhaps some writings about fun things I've been doing in my personal time
(much of which is also rather geeky).

This blog is as much for me as it is for you. The exercise of writing helps to
better organize my thoughts, and the things I write will capture and preserve
my thoughts much longer than my memory can hold. Of course I hope that others
will find value or usefulness in the things I write, but this is also something
for me to come back to and reflect on past projects and experiences that time
might otherwise steal from me.

So with that, I welcome you to my little corner of the blogosphere. Enjoy!
